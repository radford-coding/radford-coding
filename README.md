A budding PDX software developer and professional nerd, I've just graduated from the [Software Engineering Bootcamp](https://generalassemb.ly/students/courses/software-engineering-bootcamp) at General Assembly. This profile has many of my deliverables for that course, as well as extra level-up work and side projects.



When not coding, I spend my time doing partner acrobatics, DMing D&D, cooking, organizing a festival, and trying to crush my friends at board games.
