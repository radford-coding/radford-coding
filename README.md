## Hi, I'm Matt.

A budding PDX software developer and professional nerd, I'm currently studying Software Engineering at General Assembly. This profile has many of my deliverables for that course, as well as extra level-up work and side projects. 

When not coding, I spend my time doing partner acrobatics, DMing D&D, cooking, organizing a festival, and trying to crush my friends at board games.
